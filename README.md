# Video Link Vault — Final Project

A scaled-down, full-stack practice build of **Video Link Vault**: an ASP.NET Core Web API + React app that lets a user register, log in, and save, browse, filter, and delete video links from TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook — one private vault per account, organized by category and tags. Built as ASP.NET Core / React integration reps ahead of the full Video Link Vault capstone project.

## Features

- Register / log in / sign out, with a password-visibility toggle
- Per-account vault — three distinct states: logged out, logged in with an empty vault, logged in with data
- Add a link: URL, optional title, auto-detected platform (with manual override), category, comma-separated tags
- Delete a link, with the grid, footer total, and sidebar counts all updating together
- Filter by platform, by user-created category, by free-text search, and by time range — all composable
- User-created categories with live per-category counts
- YouTube thumbnails derived from the video ID, no API call required; other platforms show a placeholder card
- Click a card's thumbnail to open the video in a new tab
- Loading and error states on the link-fetch and delete paths

Full design rationale, data types, and API endpoint list are in **[PRD.md](PRD.md)**.

## Getting Started

**Backend**

```
cd Backend/Backend_Link_Vault
dotnet run
```

Runs at `https://localhost:7118` by default (confirm the port matches `Frontend/Frontend_Link_Vault/src/config.js`).

**Frontend**

```
cd Frontend/Frontend_Link_Vault
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Demo login

A demo account is seeded automatically at backend startup:

    Email:    timothy@example.com
    Password: video123

It comes preloaded with 13 sample links across all four platforms so the app is immediately demonstrable after any restart. Note: as an in-memory app, **all data resets when the backend restarts** — the demo account is the exception, since it's reseeded every time.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Route                               | Purpose                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/auth/register`                | Create an account         |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`                   | Log in                    |
| GET    | `/api/videolinks/{userId}`          | List that account's links |
| POST   | `/api/videolinks/{userId}`          | Add a link                |
| DELETE | `/api/videolinks/{userId}/{linkId}` | Delete a link             |

## Known Limitations

This is a scoped mini project (8–12 hour budget), not the capstone — a few gaps are accepted, not oversights:

- **No JWT / token auth** — `{userId}` is taken from the route with nothing to verify ownership. Deferred to the capstone.
- **All data is in-memory** — nothing persists across a backend restart except the reseeded demo account.
- **Thumbnails are YouTube-only** — TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook show a placeholder image (see [PRD.md](PRD.md) for why).

Full reasoning for every design decision and deviation from the original plan is documented in `PRD.md`.
